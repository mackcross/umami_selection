# INTRODUCTION
## Ensembl Data
The human TAS1R3 gene (ENSG00000169962; Ensembl Version ENSG00000169962.5) was viewed on 06/07/23 on 
ensembl.org. All primate orthologous sequences were downloaded (19 total sequences). Both DNA and amino acid sequences were downloaded in FASTA file format. They were saved in the "ensembl" directory. The amino acid sequences were used to guide DNA alignment. There is a checksum file with values for raw data and values generated for the aligned data.

## NCBI DATA
On 06/06/23, the human TAS1R3 DNA sequence obtained from Ensembl (ENSG00000169962; Ensembl Version ENSG00000169962.5) was input into NCBI's BlastN to find similar sequences. The standard databases nucleotide collection was searched for only highly similar sequences (megablast). 

All primate sequences not included in the Ensembl data and the flying tree shrew were downloaded (14 total sequences). The DNA and amino acid sequences were downloaded for all species and saved in the "expanded" directory. Both the DNA and amino acids were downloaded. There is a checksum file with values for raw data and values generated for the aligned data. 

## Combined Alignment
The ensembl and NCBI data were combined into a master alignment stored in the "combined_alignment" directory.
