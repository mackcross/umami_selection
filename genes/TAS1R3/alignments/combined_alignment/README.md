# ALIGNMENT
The amino acid transcripts were referenced to ensure proper reading frame.  

"TAS1R3_dna_aligned_combined" and "TAS1R3_amino_aligned_combined" were the 
intial alignments after combining the ensembl and NCBI data. Eight 
sequences has DNA segements preceding the ATG codon at position 2155. As 
the nature of PAML analyses is comparative, I made the decision to remove 
these preceding sequences. The files "cleaned_TAS1R3_dna_aligned_combined" 
and "cleaned_TAS1R3_amino_aligned_combined" were generated following this 
deletion and aligned.
