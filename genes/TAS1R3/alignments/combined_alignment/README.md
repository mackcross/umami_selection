I deleted the C at 1877 which was likely due to a transcription error. 
This change turns the codon from a guanine to an alanine, as indiated in 
amino acid transcript. 

I inserted a space at 2172 as there is a missing base at that location. 
Adding the space makes the alignment consistent with the amino acid 
transcript.
