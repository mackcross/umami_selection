# TAS1R1 Maximum Likelihood Phylogeny 

## ALIGNMENT PREPARATION
I saved copies of the alignments "trimmed_TAS1R1_dna_aligned_combined.fa" and "selected_removal_TAS1R1_dna_aligned_combined.fa" as nexus files which were stored in the ...TAS1R1/phylogeny/ directory for PAUP input. I removed any symbols which were not underscores from the sequence names, as PAUP does not accept these symbols. 

## MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD GENERATION
On 6/14/23, I used PAUP's command line (Version 4.0a (build 168) for MacOS), to individually run both the "trimmed_TAS1R1_dna_aligned_combined.fa" and "selected_removal_TAS1R1_dna_aligned_combined.fa" alignments. All PAUP parameters are documented in the alignment nexus files, as these files were used as PAUP input. PAUP output was saved in each alignment's respective directory.
