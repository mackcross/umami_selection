# INTRODUCTION
## Ensembl Data
The human TAS1R1 gene (ENSG00000173662; Ensembl Version 
ENSG00000173662.21) was viewed on 06/05/23 on 
ensembl.org. All primate orthologous sequences were downloaded (22 
total sequences). The amino acid sequences were downloaded alongside the 
DNA sequences to aid in subsequent alignment. Both were downloaded in FASTA file format. The raw and aligned formats were saved in the ensembl directory. This directory contains a checksum file with values for the raw data and the aligned data. 

## NCBI DATA
On 06/06/23, the human TAS1R1 DNA sequence obtained from Ensembl 
(ENSG00000173662; Ensembl Version 
ENSG00000173662.21) was input into NCBI's BlastN to find 
similar sequences. The standard databases nucleotide collection was searched for only highly similar sequences (megablast). The results were filtered to include only primates. Any returning sequences that included primates not represented by the Ensembl data were downloaded and placed within the expanded file. O


## Ensebml Alignment 
The Ottolemur sequence contained a codon before the ATG sequence which was 
removed.
