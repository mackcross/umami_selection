# INTRODUCTION
## Ensembl Data
The human TAS1R1 gene (ENSG00000173662; Ensembl Version 
ENSG00000173662.21) was viewed on 5/16/23 on 
ensembl.org. All primate orthologous sequences were downloaded (22 
total sequences). The amino acid sequences (checksum: 
54e4823a77edc7d735a3a8f6975a9d6d139b2c98) were downloaded alongside the 
DNA sequences (checksum: 08450e5e76dccab25ab852916154072dd22600b8) to aid in 
subsequent alignment. Both were downloaded in FASTA file format. 

## NCBI DATA
On 5/16/23, the human TAS1R1 DNA sequence obtained from Ensembl 
(ENSG00000173662; Ensembl Version 
ENSG00000173662.21)  was input into NCBI's BlastN to find 
similar sequences. The results were filtered to include only primates. 


## Ensebml Alignment 
The Ottolemur sequence contained a codon before the ATG sequence which was 
removed.
