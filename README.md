The directory contains my initial analysis, which I completed as a masters 
student, and my final analysis, which I completed several years later to 
better ensure robusticity of result. For the final analysis, I used the 
exact same initial alignment versions. I reran the ML tree with a more 
efficient PAUP* block and re-ran the exact same PAML analysis. 
The directory structures between the initial version and this version are 
different as well.
