On 8/22/25, I downloaded the TAS1R3 orthologues for all primates and rodents / related species in Ensembl. For some reason, tree shrews were categorized within "rodents / related species" despite being more closely related to primates than rodents. Therefore, I deleted all species in rodents / related species aside from tree shrews, as I wanted the tree shrew to serve as the outgroup. Next, I changed the Ensembl names to match the species name. I created a separate file "Ensembl_Names" where I pasted the original Ensembl names for each of the sequences and their new name for my analysis, which can serve as a key.
