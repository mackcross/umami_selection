On 5/1/25, I downloaded data from Ensembl for TAS1R1 (ENSG00000173662). I downloaded all 23 primate orthologues. I noted that there were 3 primates in Ensembl without a TAS1R1 orthologue, which included Angola colobus (Colobus angolensis palliatus), Ugandan red Colobus (Piliocolobus tephrosceles) and Gelada (Theropithecus gelada). 

On 6/9/2025, I worked with both the protein and DNA alignments from 
Ensembl. I aligned the protein with muscle, then aligned the DNA to be 
consistent with the protein alignment. Additionally, for the Galago 
sequence, there was an extra amino acid in front of the methionine amino 
acid, and this also occured in teh DNA alignment as there was an "AGC" in 
front of "ATG." I removed this from both the protein and amino acid 
alignment, but it can be observed in the raw data files.
